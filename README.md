# Bestreddit 🤖

### Intro 
Bestreddit :- A site with complete collection of popular and useful subreddits which is completely maintained by opensource community 🚪

#
### How to Contribute 🤝?
 Contributions are the key which runs the entire repo. All kind of Contributions are appreciated  .    
 
📝 We mainly focus on building the Data Base which contains the informations regarding the Subreddits.  

The entire datas related to the subreddits are contained in the `/data/data.js`.
`data.js` contains a set of JSON data which holds the data and it is in the format 
```
 {
    "make": "Programming",
    "type": "Programming",
    "Link": "/r/programmin/"
  },
  {
    "make": "Ask your Questions",
    "type": "Information",
    "Link": "/r/AskReddit"
  }
  ```
  `make` :- This can be the sub-reddit name,If the Name is not very specific to the Groups content then you can set the value of `make` key to something that is related to the content of the group.
  If it is too confusing then simply set the value to the subreddit name itself 🍻 . 
  
  `type` :- This key is for specifying the category of the subreddit.  
  
  `Link` :- Yah!! Definitely the link of the Group 🏳   
  
 The search is based on multiple factors and hence try to keep the `type` and `make` more focused and straight
 
 ### Adding Data
 Make a Pull request after adding the data to `data.js`. It is that simple 🤗 .
 
 I will be nice if you could mention that you are updating `data.js` in the pull request title.
 
 🎇 You can also make change to the `website` and submit a Pull Request. New Suggestions,Features,Bug-Fixes,Color-Changes,UI-Changes etc.. All kind of contrubitons are accepted
 and make sure you keep an eye on `data.js` which is the core of the repo and make effort to increase the DB
